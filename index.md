### Personal ###

##### Podcasts #####
There is never a day that goes by where I don't listen to at least one podcast. I usually start my day by listening to Up First and The Indicator by NPR, followed by Seeking Alpha's Wall Street Breakfast, and finally with Gary Arndt's Everything Everywhere Daily. I have found this to be a nice combination of daily news and political briefing, with some financial, economic, and stock market driven updates feathered in. This routine also ensures I learn at least one new thing everyday with Arndt's informative stories. I tend to followup by listening to a handful of pocasts from a variety of different genres, from Sports, Technology, Business, Science, History, True Crime, and Politics. Currently, my fifteen favorite podcasts are...

- Black Box Down
- Business Breakdowns
- Darknet Diaries
- Fall of Civilizations Podcast
- Huberman Lab
- Lex Fridman Podcast
- Murder with my Husband
- New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce
- Odd Lots
- Opening Arguments
- SuperMegaCast
- Redefining Energy
- The Old Man and the Three with JJ Reddick and Tommy Alter
- The WAN Show
- Through the Wire


##### Saxophone #####
I have been playing the saxophone for around a decade or so now, and although I don't get it out nearly as much as I used to, I still love to play. I currently play on a used Yamaha YAS62III. The piece I have been using is a custom Philtone Solstice (.080") w/ Rigotti Golds (2.5 Medium or 2.5 Strong).
