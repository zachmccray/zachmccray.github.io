# **Zachary McCray (He/Him)**

Hello! I am currently a junior pursuing a [Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Computer Science, with a concentration in Economics](https://catalog.ku.edu/engineering/electrical-engineering-computer-science/bs-interdisciplinary-computing/#text), and an [Undergraduate Certificate in Cybersecurity](https://catalog.ku.edu/engineering/electrical-engineering-computer-science/ugcertificate-cybersecurity/#text).

I am a now three year member of the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of KU](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/ACLU), where, as a two year member of leadership, I help educate the commmunity about their rights and discuss with members the important political topics which impact us today. Furthermore, I represent the ACLU during the local Civic Enangement & Leadership meetings, where representatives from select clubs at the University of Kansas meet to explore ways to get the community involved in civic engagement. Addtionally, I am on the leadership team for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Club, and I am a member of the [KU Solar Car](https://www.kusolarcar.com/), [KU Chess Club](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/kuchessclub), [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/acm), and [Economics Club](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/kueconclub). Along with this, I find solace volunteering at the [Lawrence Humane Society](https://lawrencehumane.org/) — the local animal shelter here in Lawrence — where I eventually adopted my first kitten, [Jack](https://imgur.com/gallery/YAmj6q5). I also have many hobbies, some of which include [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/zacharymccray), [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/zachmccray.22?si=af033328f63942d7), and [playing video games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zacharymccray/)!
