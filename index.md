# **Zachary McCray**

Hello! I am currently a junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Economics from the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/). I am a now three year member of the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of KU](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/ACLU), where, as a two year member of leadership, I help educate and discuss with members the important political topics which impact us today. Additionally, I am a member of the [Economics Club](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/kueconclub), [AI Organization](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/artificialintelligence), and [ACM](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/acm) at KU. 

Along with this, I find solace volunteering at the [Lawrence Humane Society](https://lawrencehumane.org/) — the local animal shelter here in Lawrence — where I eventually adopted my first kitten, Jack. I also have many hobbies, some of which include [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/zacharymccray), [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/zachmccray.22?si=af033328f63942d7), and [playing video games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zacharymccray/)!
