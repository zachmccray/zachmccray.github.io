## Personal ##
### Books ###
I try and read almost everyday, and I typically enjoy books from a range of different genres. My personal favorites are historical fiction, crime, memoir, history, nonfiction, philosophy, and science. To learn more about my favorite books, visit my [Books](https://zachmccray.github.io/personal_books) page. I also have a Goodreads account, which can be found [here](https://www.goodreads.com/zacharymccray).

### Podcasts ###
There is never a day that goes by where I don't listen to at least one podcast. I usually start my day by listening to Up First and The Indicator by NPR, followed by Seeking Alpha's Wall Street Breakfast, and finally with Gary Arndt's Everything Everywhere Daily. I tend to followup by listening to a handful of pocasts from a variety of different genres, from Sports, Technology, Business, Science, History, True Crime, and Politics. To learn more about my favorite podcasts, visit my [Podcasts](https://zachmccray.github.io/personal_podcasts) page.

### Saxophone ###
I have been playing the saxophone for around a decade or so now, and although I don't get it out nearly as much as I used to, I still love to play. I currently play on a used Yamaha YAS62III. The mouthpiece I am using is a custom Philtone Solstice (.080") w/ Rigotti Golds (2.5 Medium or 2.5 Strong).
