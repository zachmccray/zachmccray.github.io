# **Zachary McCray (He/Him)**

Hello! I am currently a junior pursuing a [Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Computer Science, with a concentration in Economics](https://catalog.ku.edu/engineering/electrical-engineering-computer-science/bs-interdisciplinary-computing/#text) with a [Minor in Mathematics](https://catalog.ku.edu/liberal-arts-sciences/math/minor/).

I am a now three year member of the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of KU](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/ACLU), where, as a two year member of leadership, I help educate our commmunity about their rights and discuss the important political topics which impact us today. Addtionally, I am a part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Club, and I am also a member of the [KU Solar Car](https://www.kusolarcar.com/), [KU Chess Club](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/kuchessclub), [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://rockchalkcentral.ku.edu/organization/acm), [HEAL KU](https://healku.carrd.co/). Along with this, I find solace in volunteering at the [Lawrence Humane Society](https://lawrencehumane.org/) — the local animal shelter here in Lawrence — where I eventually adopted my first kitten, [Jack](https://imgur.com/gallery/YAmj6q5). I also have many hobbies, some of which include [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/zacharymccray), [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/zachmccray.22?si=af033328f63942d7), and [playing video games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zacharymccray/)!
