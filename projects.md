### Connect Four
A project created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for my EECS368 Programming Language Paradigms final assignment. The game is played using one machine, where two players face off in a turn-based strategy match until a winner is decided, or the game concludes in a draw. You can find the game [here](https://zachmccray-connect-four.glitch.me/), where it is hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com/@zachmccray).
